# screenrc
screenrc settings in my environment

PROMPT_COMMAND is not properly set in my .bashrc profile due to which I have to use this hack.

1. F1 key sends PROMPT_COMMAND to all windows
2. F2 key will do windowlist -b (choose from a list of windows)
3. F3 key will go to previous window
4. F4 key will go to next window.
5. hardstatus is set to show window titles at the bottom.
