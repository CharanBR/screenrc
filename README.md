# screenrc
screenrc settings in my environment

PROMPT_COMMAND is not properly set in my .bashrc profile due to which I have to use this hack.

1. F1 key sends PROMPT_COMMAND to all windows
2. F2 key will do windowlist -b (choose from a list of windows)
3. F3 key will go to previous window
4. F4 key will go to next window.
5. hardstatus is set to show window titles at the bottom.
6. Escape key changed to C-j for users using emac style command prompt/emacs.
